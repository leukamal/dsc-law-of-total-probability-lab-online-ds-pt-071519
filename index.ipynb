    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and explain the concept of event space and partitioning \n",
    "* State the law of total probabilities based on a partitioned event space\n",
    "* Understand and be able to perform partitioning based on known and unknown probabilities to solve a problem"
